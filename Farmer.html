<p>A farmer raises <span name="eltAnimal"></span> on a small farm.</p>
 
<p>Yesterday the farmer did a survey, counting the number of <span name="eltAnimal"></span> in each field and writing the data down in a list:</p>
 
<ul>
  <li>Field 1: <span id="eltField1"></span> <span name="eltAnimal"></span>;</li>
  <li>Field 2: <span id="eltField2"></span> <span name="eltAnimal"></span>;</li>
  <li>Field 3: <span id="eltField3"></span> <span name="eltAnimal"></span>;</li>
  <li>Field 4: <span id="eltField4"></span> <span name="eltAnimal"></span>;</li>
  <li>Field 5: <span id="eltField5"></span> <span name="eltAnimal"></span>;</li>
  <li>Field 6: <span id="eltField6"></span> <span name="eltAnimal"></span>;</li>
  <li>Field 7: <span id="eltField7"></span> <span name="eltAnimal"></span>;</li>
  <li>Field 8: <span id="eltField8"></span> <span name="eltAnimal"></span>;</li>
  <li>Field 9: <span id="eltField9"></span> <span name="eltAnimal"></span>;</li>
</ul>
 
<p>The farmer then copied the data into the frequency table shown below.</p>
 
<table border collapse>

<p>A farmer grows <span name="eltCrop"></span> on a small farm.</p>
corn wheat barley oats barley potatoes turnips cherries apples carrots broccoli cabbages peas

<p>Yesterday the farmer finished harvesting the wheat and weighed what each field produced, writing the data down in a list:</p>

Field 1: 46.6 kg
Field 2: 75.2 kg â€¦
The farmer then copied the data into the grouped frequency table shown below.
Weight harvested (kg)   Frequency
0 w 50
50 w 100
 
How many fields produced between 50 and 100 kg of wheat?
What is the modal class?
How many fields did the farmer harvest?
How much wheat did the farmer harvest altogether?
Estimate the mean weight of wheat produced by a field.
